Algorithm SHO_GCP:

Input: The Graph G, Max_itr
Output: Chromatic Coloring of G

Steps:
	1. Initialize Agents.
	2. Calculate fitness of Agents.
	3. Determine Prey and Hyenaes.
	4. While termination condition not met do:
		4.1. Identify the potential candidate solutions, the number of those solutions N and create the cluster, vector C.
		4.2. For each Agents do:
			4.2.1. change the position of the Agent with,
				vector P := vector C / N .
		4.3. Identify any one agent as Prey and the rest as Hyenaes.
		4.4. Calculate vectors B, E, h.
		4.5. Calculate Distance of each Agents from Prey i.e., the vector D.
		4.3. Update the positions of Hyenas based on the Prey's position.
		4.4. Update fitness.
	5. Return Prey
