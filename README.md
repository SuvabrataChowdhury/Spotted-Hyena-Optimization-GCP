<p>All agents related functions and datatypes are in agents.h (like agent datatype, getInitialPopulation, displayAgents, getTotalColor etc.).</p>
<p>All graph related functions and datatypesÂ are in graph.h (like graph datatype, adj matrix initialization, maxDegree calculation etc.).</p>
<p>Graph is to be supplied with command line argument.</p>
<p>The example graph (5 vertices, 7 edges), named boat.txt, is in folder TEST_DATASET along with some other small graphs.</p>
<p>To change the directory to GCP_DATASET edit line 34.</p>
<p>Only the initial population has been generated and displayed in a tabular form.</p>
