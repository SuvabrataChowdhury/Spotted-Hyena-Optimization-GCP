<p>The agents are roaming about a toroidal world where each principle axis is no longer a straight lines reaching infinity but those loop after the given bound units (in here it is the best obtained chromatic number so far). Need to study the geometry of such a toroidal world for further improvement of this algorithm</p>
<p>Cluster has been done by taking the center of the path which contains most increasing regions. Regions around the prey needs to be explored much more frequently</p>
